Natacha Mia Kristensen, a volunteer and activist from Greenpeace, was born and raised in Aalborg. She is 29 years old and now studies biology at Aalborg University. She is an experienced volunteer, having started already at the beginning of 2012. She dedicates her time to Greenpeace, a global organization which has offices in 41 countries and four groups in Denmark alone.
Can you tell us more about Greenpeace?
In my opinion, Greenpeace is the best environmental organization there is. Our aim is to protect our planet and therefore the creatures living on it by making the future green and peaceful. We want to protect the world’s nature and preserve biodiversity. Our focus areas are climate and energy, forests, the oceans, toxic chemicals, sustainable agriculture and they are against nuclear power and weapons. Greenpeace is not afraid to go from words to action in a non-violent and creative way. Moreover, we are an economical and politically independent organization.

**Why Greenpeace?**

Because the organization fights for a better world where nature has the highest priority. For me, there is no more important cause to focus on because without nature humanity stands no chance in the long-term. Scary changes due to climate change are already happening. I also like Greenpeace’s core values and the way they work. Our organization is well-known in the world and actions of volunteers across the globe attract a lot of attention which usually creates change. I love to be with Greenpeace on the action because you really feel that you are making a difference somehow — and you get to know new like-minded people or see the good old ones.

**What change have you contributed to?**

I have been on a Greenpeace action in Dybvad, Northern Jutland, which was against the extracting of shale gas. We trespassed the drilling site and blocked the workers and put up a banner — we were at the site for almost 24 hours. TV2 and other journalists came by and documented our presence. The politicians started to talk about the issue after our action — it was close to the election so the different politicians' parties started to state their meaning of shale gas — and suddenly most of Denmark knew what shale gas was — there had not been a lot of attention on the issue before our action.

**What’s Greenpeace’s international campaign for this year?**

One of the main campaigns this year is the “Less Meat — More Plants” campaign. Here the aim is to get the mayors of every municipality in Denmark to reduce the meat consumption by serving less meat and more plant-based options in every official institution. They don’t have to take the meat all off the menu — just reduce it. We are eating way too much meat in Denmark which pollutes the environment and it’s not necessary.

**Danish cuisine is to a great extent based on meat. Do you think that a change in this matter is possible?**

There’s a long way to go, but I think it’s possible. Over the last couple of years, a lot of new plant-based alternatives have shown a sales increase in the markets all around the major cities of Denmark and around the world. I think we need to do something to enthusiastically inspire people to make the change instead of just going around and pointing fingers. But it’s still important to spread the word and sometimes it can be hard to do without sounding to knowingly or crazy — especially on this topic. But always do your best to do it in a good manner.

**Denmark likes to be pictured as a very green country. Do you think it is the reality or is it more just a wish?**

We used to be on the top of the list of the greenest countries in the world, but that picture is slowly starting to crumble. One of the reasons is our emissions of Nitrogen from agriculture into our waters and atmosphere. Another reason which is also due to agriculture is our emissions of CO2 — which come from our massive meat consumption and production and the transportation of the meat. The agriculture has been prioritized over nature for a long time here in Denmark — even over a Natura 2000 law which is a part of an EU-project that aims to protect nature and its biodiversity. Denmark has been a green country and we still wish to be seen as one of the best — and yeah, we are not the worst, but we can still do better — we once did.

**If you could make a difference overnight here in Aalborg what would be the one difference that you want to implement right away?**

The first one I think would be to reduce meat consumption and production. Because it’s such a huge pollution source. My second one… I would invest in Some renewable energy and get detached from all the fossil fuels.

**What about, for example, the segregation of trash?**

It’s getting better some places, but it can still be improved. It needs to be easier for people to sort out their trash at home, at work and in public spaces. It’s both the mindset of the people and the effort from the municipalities that need a boost. Maybe some kind of education on this topic and more distinct trashcans would help so that we could get a more user-friendly system going. I have heard of a good idea of making the trashcans fun to hit in various ways — it’s usually simple, cheap and people tend to use them more when they, for example, are formed as a fish and the trash has to go into its mouth.

**What kind of events do you do here locally?**

We do a lot of different events. One of the most recent ones was a screening event of the documentary “BLUE” where we co-hosted with Project 2030 and Dyrenes Alliance. One of Greenpeace’s campaigns this year is, in short-term, trying to get Denmark to reduce its meat production and consumption. Therefore, Greenpeace Aalborg participated in The Sustainability Festival in September last year where we served plant-based food, shared information on the subject and collected signatures for the campaign. In Greenpeace Aalborg, we both focus on the international and national campaigns, but we also have some local issues which are on the agenda. The volunteers are also allowed to come up with ideas that are consistent with Greenpeace’s values.

**What are some of the upcoming events of Greenpeace?**

At the beginning of April, we are co-hosting on a plogging event here in Aalborg. Also, Greenpeace Aalborg is having an introductory meeting for new potential volunteers on the 18th of March. We are also collaborating with a different organization on “Folkets Klimamarch” — The Climate March of the people — which will take place a week or two before the election here in Denmark. We also want to participate in The Sustainability Festival again. We have some more good ideas which haven’t been fully planned yet.

**From all the events that you’ve had so far, do you have a favourite?**

I always find it hard to pick out an event as a favourite. It’s really hard to say it because they eventually end up being great in different ways. You always learn a lot and meet a lot of different people. I have to say I just love to be out there making a difference and fighting for what I love — the magnificent and fragile nature.
If you can share with the youth in Aalborg any message, what would it be?
Find out what makes your heart scream for change and go fight for that.
