summary: "When you meet people who are learning Danish, you should let them try to speak it. Try to talk slowly and let them understand what you are saying, instead of switching to English because it´s easier. Maybe it takes more time, but you need to be patient, and you will eventually help them a lot."

Learning a language can be enriching. Learning the language of the country you live in is a necessity. For our next feature of People of Aalborg, we met up with Hannah, a 20 years old student at UCN who wants to become a teacher in Danish, German and Religion. What brought us to her is the fact that every Monday, she volunteers at the library of Sprogcenter, where people struggling with Danish can get some free help.

**You’re a volunteer at sprog center, can you tell me how and when it began?**

I contacted Danish Refugee Help about one year ago. I wasn´t sure what the possibilities were, but I wanted to become a volunteer in an area of interest close to what I study.

**Why exactly did you choose to become a volunteer there specifically?**

It was not me who chose to be at the Sprogcenter, it was because it was the only place that needed help at that moment. There are also some people in the library and other places, but the Sprogcenter was urgently looking for someone. That’s why I went there.

**What do you do as a volunteer at Sprogcenter?**

I go there every Monday from 6 to 8 pm. There I meet both students from the Sprogcenter, but also other people who don´t go to the paid courses. They come and get help with homework or they just practice and improve their Danish. Some of them come when the exams are approaching — those need some help with the presentations they have prepared. It’s very different. Some people also seek help with an application for a job or something more official like this.

**Is it free for everyone to come?**

Yes, everyone is welcome, not just the students of the Sprogcenter.

**Do you also offer help to complete beginners?**

It’s not a class, it´s just me or other volunteers walking around and helping. The teachers are also present and able to find some papers or materials for you. But it´s mostly the people bringing their own homework or presentations for an exam. You can always come and learn a little bit, just as much as you want.

**Have any of the experiences with the students there left a personal impact on you?**

I don’t know if it’s just one situation, but I meet many people there. They are very nice and friendly, there’s a very positive atmosphere. I like to meet all of these different people and try to help them the best I can and it makes me feel very nice. I think it is the atmosphere in general that makes it so memorable for me.

**What kind of people come most often?**

It’s both students who already study here, refugees or people who want to work in Denmark and are studying Danish in order to get a job. Some of them only speak their native language and we can only talk together in Danish because they don’t even speak English. But sometimes even their Danish is quite poor, so I have to try to communicate in the best way I can.

**Does this lead to funny situations where you have to use your body language?**

Yes, and often you have to repeat the sentence a couple of times because you have to be sure that you understand each other.

**Are some of the people who come more regular ones? Or is it every time different faces that show up on Monday?**

Uh no. Sometimes it’s people that I already know, who are there every Monday. But it’s different because they have different schedules at school. I’ve only experienced two times when there were no people, but normally one to five or six people come to get some help.

**From what nationalities would you say are most of the students that come during the voluntary hours?**

It’s very different. I’ve personally met a lot of people from Iraq, Afghanistan, Morocco and Iran. But also from Europe, like Poland.

**And would you say that Aalborg provides the internationals with enough opportunities to integrate language-wise?**

I think so. I think there are many great opportunities to get help here in Aalborg if you know about it. Where you can come and talk to volunteers like me. Also — When I’m at the Sprogcenter, I’m always together with a teacher so I can also get help if I need it.

**What do you think about the fact that people now have to pay for the official courses?**

I know that some of the people who come here and then when they can’t speak Danish, they are not able to get a job. I think that’s very frustrating for these people. And I know they would like to work on their Danish, but they are really running low on money and can’t possibly afford it.

**The Danish authorities are now complaining about the international students only using Denmark to get free education not trying to integrate into the society. Isn’t learning Danish the key?**

Yes, I don’t think you can expect people to get integrated if you don’t give them enough opportunities. I think it’s already very expensive to live in Denmark, with basic expenses like accommodation or food.

**You mentioned that you want to become a teacher — is there a personal motivation why you pursue that career path in particular?**

I like languages, they have always fascinated me. I really like the Danish language and grammar. I, therefore, enjoy going to the Sprogcenter and helping people with it, because I can use some of my knowledge about it. And it’s also a good training for me, even though I’m studying to be an elementary school teacher.

**If you could share any message to the youth in Aalborg through this interview, what would it be?**

When you meet people who are learning Danish, you should let them try to speak it. Try to talk slowly and let them understand what you are saying, instead of switching to English because it´s easier. Maybe it takes more time, but you need to be patient, and you will eventually help them a lot.
