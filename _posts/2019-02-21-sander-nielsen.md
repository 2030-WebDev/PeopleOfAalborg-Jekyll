Sander Kielgaard Nielsen is twenty-one years old and was born and raised in Aalborg. In his spare time, he likes to play the guitar, watch TV series, and spend his time with his friends. Once or twice a week, he goes to Elsk Aalborg to teach foreigners Danish for free.

**When did you become a volunteer?**

About three years ago, when I had a little pause with school, and that would be roughly the time when I started here.

**What made you become a volunteer here at Elsk?**

I was at first looking for an ordinary job, but I couldn’t find one. It was my mother who told me about Elsk Aalborg in the first place. I got interested, met Hanna Pedersen, our so-called boss, and that’s when it all started for me.

**Can you tell us more about Elsk Aalborg? How often do you teach? Whom do you teach?**

It depends on the time I can find for it, but usually, I teach twice a week from three to four o’clock. Right now, I’m teaching the second level of four, the so-called beginner, as the first level we call below-beginners.

**How can someone join? Does, for example, the beginner level start in September and February like the semesters?**

It’s not fixed in any way. People can join in whenever they want. They can also move from level to level whenever they want. Us, the teachers, move them only very rarely. But level one, the below-beginners, as I’ve said, is usually very crowded, so we try to encourage people to step up as early as possible.

**How big are the groups?**

It depends on many things, amongst others on the weather. People don’t want to go out if it’s raining and to get soaked. Truly. So sometimes I end up teaching twenty people, sometimes twelve and sometimes only four.

**Have you experienced a situation where something has happened while teaching, such as a student saying something, which has left an impact on you?**

Actually, yes. I’m very happy to hear some feedback all the time. It’s also nice to see students move up and confess to me that they actually see a change in their everyday life, such as that they aren’t that afraid of communicating in Danish anymore. That makes me really happy, and I’m glad that I have helped to help them make them grow.

**The core of Elsk is Christian. This is a Christian community as far as I understand it…**

That is true, but I’m personally not a Christian, nor are all of the volunteers in here, and Elsk tries to make it clear that it doesn’t force anyone to do anything or believe in anything particular, and that everyone is welcome, no matter of the actual religious belief. Every Sunday, there is a holy mass in our place in Hjulmagervej, but again, everyone is welcome.

**Have you heard of the sustainability goals set by the United Nations by 2030? Two of the goals are about a world where there’s no inequality and there’s complete cultural understanding. And language is like the key to it. Do you think that all the people that come newly in Aalborg are offered enough opportunities to learn the language?**

I’d say yes. The international community is getting bigger and bigger. It’s true that some internationals I get to talk to haven’t even heard about Elsk Aalborg, so the knowledge is not so widely spread, but I believe that if you want, you can always find a way, and Elsk Aalborg can be a big part of it.

**If you can share any message with youth in Aalborg, what would it be?**

I would advise internationals and refugees to not be scared of changes, because there are a lot of different people in Denmark and you can always find people that are just like you and you will blend in, no matter what you believe in or not. It doesn’t mean you need to know the language completely. Just a small thing like being able to introduce yourself can have a huge impact. It shows that you are really trying to blend in, and that’s what Danish people appreciate.

Elsk opening hours: Every Tuesday and Thursday 14.00–18.00
